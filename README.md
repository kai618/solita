# Solita

A Klondike (Solitaire) game I made in my spare time, tried to learn and apply Draggable and DragTarget widgets of Flutter at first, then polished it up with some auto-drag animation to improve UX.  
It is now playable but many more features are still incomplete. I will continue this project soon when I can find some free time.
